# A Simulation Framework for Cloud Workflow Scheduling Based on CloudSim

## Features

- Supports multi-workflow scheduling across geo-distributed data centers.
- Supports Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), with consideration for transient faults induced by DVFS technology.
- Features a job retry mechanism that automatically re-executes jobs upon transient fault occurrences.
- Supports the generation of various types of workflow instances, such as Montage, CyberShake, and more. Additionally, the number of jobs in a workflow can be customized.
- Supports workflow parsing and displays the workflow structure graph.
